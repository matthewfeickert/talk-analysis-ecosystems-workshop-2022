# Info slide (remove before talk)

* Time: .bold[15 minutes] talk + 5 minutes questions
* Concept notes from Alex:
   - Really what it is about is talking about analyzer user experience
   - Briefly talk more generally about the ecosystem
      - not everyone will be very familiar, though participants will get pre-workshop material
   - Future-facing thoughts about ecosystem would also fit well (white paper recommendations)
